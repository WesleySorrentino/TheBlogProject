# Wesley's Blog

This is my second attempt building a app using ASP.net. I was able to follow a tutorial by following CoderFoundry on YouTube. 
After a few months of finding time to build their version of the blog app I am now here. [Click here to see live server](https://blog.wesleysorrentino.com/).

## Technoligies used
I used C# and Asp.net for the framework, Database I used PostgreSQL and for frontend I used Bootstrap 5, with additional help from Summernote and SweetAlert.
